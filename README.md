<h4>Want a fun and annoying way to find out if you have gained instagram followers?</h4>
Introducing <strong>instaAnnoy</strong>
As long as you keep your window open you will get a wonderful notification sound that you have a new follower!!

To make it your own, first you'll have to generate your own instagram token.
You can do that by logging into instagram account on your PC and going to [this link](http://instagram.pixelunion.net/) and clicking on "Generate token"
Then go into the code and find the following part.
```javascript
//paste your instagram provided token
var token = <instagram access token>;
```
Change ```<instagram access token>``` with your new generated token (don't forget to put the quotation marks around it)

Now just save it wait for it to refresh and it should be working!
